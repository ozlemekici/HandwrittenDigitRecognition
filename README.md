# Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

**Dataset**
<br/>
We are going to implement a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset. This is probably one of the most popular datasets among machine learning and deep learning enthusiasts. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.

**What is CNN?**
<br/>
Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of Deep Learning Algorithm that take the image as an input and learn the various features of the image through filters. This allows them to learn the important objects present in the image, allowing them to discern one image from the other. For example, the convolutional network will learn the specific features of cats that differentiate from the dogs so that when we provide input of cats and dogs, it can easily differentiate between the two. One important feature of Convolutional Neural Network that sets it apart from other Machine Learning algorithms is its ability to pre-process the data by itself. Thus, you may not spend a lot of resources in data pre-processing. During cold-start, the filters may require hand engineering but with progress in training, they are able to adapt to the learned features and develop filters of their own. Therefore, CNN is continuously evolving with growth in the data.

**Create GUI to predict digits**
<br/>
For the GUI, we have created a new file in which we build an interactive window to draw digits on canvas and with a button, we can recognize the digit. The Tkinter library comes in the Python standard library. We have created a function predict_digit() that takes the image as input and then uses the trained model to predict the digit.
<br/>
Then we create the App class which is responsible for building the GUI for our app. We create a canvas where we can draw by capturing the mouse event and with a button, we trigger the predict_digit() function and display the results.
